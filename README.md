### Hi there 👋

📌 My latest blog post: [Generate More Leads For Your Livestorm Webinars With a Chatbot](https://blog.csml.dev/generate-more-leads-for-your-livestorm-webinars-with-a-chatbot/)

I am the co-creator of [CSML 🦜](https://csml.dev), an [open-source programming language written in Rust](https://github.com/CSML-by-Clevy/csml-engine) that makes it extremely easy to develop powerful and rich chatbots/voicebots.  
I'm also the co-founder and CTO of [Clevy.io](https://www.clevy.io), a startup based in Paris. We make awesome chatbots for great companies.

I mostly code in Rust and Javascript, and I'm quite skilled at cloud ☁️  stuff.

I'm also a [former Rubik's cube champion](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2004SECH01) with a best time of 11.15s, which sucks by today's standards but was very good in 2006 🤓
