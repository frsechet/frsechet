### Hi there 👋

📌 My last blog post: [Add Natural Language Understanding capabilities to CSML Studio chatbots with Amazon Lex](https://blog.csml.dev/amazon-lex-csml-studio/)

I am the co-creator of CSML 🦜, an [open-source programming language written in Rust](https://github.com/CSML-by-Clevy/csml-engine) that makes it extremely easy to develop powerful and rich chatbots/voicebots.  
I'm also the co-founder and CTO of Clevy.io, a startup based in Paris. We make awesome chatbots for great companies.

I mostly code in Rust and Javascript, and I'm quite skilled at cloud ☁️ stuff.

I'm also a former Rubik's cube champion with a best time of 11.15s, which sucks by today's standards but was very good in 2006 🤓
