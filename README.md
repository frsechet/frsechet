### Hi there 👋

I am an Engineering Director at [Fountain](https://www.fountain.com), in charge of developing the greatest suite of frontline worker experience software.

I am the co-creator of [CSML 🦜](https://csml.dev), an [open-source programming language written in Rust](https://github.com/CSML-by-Clevy/csml-engine) that makes it extremely easy to develop powerful and rich chatbots/voicebots. I'm also the co-founder and CTO of [Clevy.io](https://www.clevy.io), a startup based in Paris (acquired).

I mostly code in JS, TS and Rust, and I'm otherwise quite skilled at cloud ☁️  stuff.

I'm also a [former Rubik's cube champion](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2004SECH01) with a best time of 11.15s, which sucks by today's standards but was very good back in 2006 🤓
